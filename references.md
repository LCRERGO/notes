---------------
Here some of my best references about unrelated subjects will be aggregated

## Signal Processing
- [Xiph Video](xiph.org/video)
: Xiph is a foundation that tries to make the multimedia Internet free from
private interests. In this series they explain a **lot** about signal
processing, audio and video encodings.

## System Administration(Linux)
- [Sysctl Explorer](https://sysctl-explorer.net/)
: Sysctl Explorer is a compreheensive referece for sysctl documentation. Since
most of sysctl options are scattered through architecture specific pages under
Kernel documention having a indexed reference for that is a lot of help.

- [Repology](https://repology.org/)
: Repology is search engine to query software package versions on different
computer systems including BSDs and Linux distributions.
