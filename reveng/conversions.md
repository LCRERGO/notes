# conversions
-------------
In assembly there are a few conversions that should be known
- If you subtract *0x30* to a number character you transform it into
it's numeric value.
- If you add or subtract *0x20* from an alphabetic character it gets converted
into it's lower or upper part (it should be noted that on the ASCII table
lowercase character goes after the uppercase ones).
